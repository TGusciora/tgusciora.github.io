Since the beginning of ages, people have had problems with ordering files on their desktops. You could easily imagine a honest day of work in ancient Egypt, opening your "Pyramid_resources" folder and seeing there something like this:
- "limestone.jpg"
- "limestone_v1.jpg", 
- "limestone_v4.jpg", 
- "limestone_v4_but_better.jpg", 
- "limestone_v3_sent_from_Anubis_Final.jpg" 

What the hell are you supposed to do with this?! Which limestone should be used for today's construction batch? There is an enhanced version 4 at hand, but I am not sure if Anubis isn't someone who has the final say around here...

To sum it up in one sentence: it's a mess! And you'd like to avoid it.

Thankfully, kind souls at prestigious universities like Oxford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) face similar challenges and have developed guidelines on how to organize your project files. I'll do my best to combine those with my data science experience and share a recipe for a project structure that features:

- Usability - easy to understand
- Maintainability - easy to change and update
- Reusability - easy to use in other projects or applications
- Portability - easy to shift to other systems
- Modularity - can be easily decomposed into smaller, independent pieces

Although it's past Dry January, I will also cover the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle in programming.

All of the above should make your projects more standardized, easier to kick off, and over time - bring more joy to your work. I don’t recommend reinventing the wheel each time; this allows you to save precious brain energy for thinking about things like flying saucers, a cure for cancer, or where you left your car keys.

Hop on! There's a lot to explain!
