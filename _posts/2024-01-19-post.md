Family Guy reference intended. Great series.

Have you ever tried to work on a project for so long, that your open-source libraries stopped cooperating? Do you have an environment that needs to run multiple programs on different versions of software? Visual Studio Code + Docker Desktop might be just the right combination for you.

Because it's rather not a question if that will happen, but when.

## A little bit of history (and a personal touch)

I consider myself a recovering lazy person. Throughout my life I have been living in a spiral of periods of excessive activity (sports, reading or partying) mixed with periods of numbness (playing games whole day, watching series all day, watching that one last video of cat riding through a rainbow at the end of the Internet). That changed when I introduced 2 elements to my daily routine: structure and small successes. But that's a story for another time. 

One of artifacts that I have from such periods of numbness is that I have never finished my master's thesis (thankfully at least I have my bachelor's degree). Actually twice I came close. In 2015 when I was first finishing my master's courses I became eligible to write a masters thesis. But I didn't do anything except thinking of a title. Then I moved overseas and didn't think about it a lot, but unfinished business hanged around my neck like a rock. I came back to my country in 2019 and around 2020 I decided that I will take master's courses again. And so I did - I switched to a slightly different type of degree within Economics department, had to pass around 15 subjects due to differences in programme, and in 2022 ended up in the same scenario that I had in 2015. I had to write my master's thesis. Obviously it would be just too simple if I would write it immediately then. So I started to work on it just in 2023. Small steps - everyday 30 min focused block of working on it (again, story for another time).

Until October everything was going fine - I got 30 pages written in LaTeX (you probably picked up already that I like to make things more difficult than they should be. Or I like ambitious tasks. Or both. It depends.). Then I enrolled to a very labour-intensive AI Development course - which I spent around 5 weeks on without working on anything else. During course to communicate and use Python OpenAI library I did update my Python version from 3.9 to 3.12. When I finished the course and returned in glory - I decided to resume working on my thesis. 

Then it happened. The horror. The code that I was writing for the empirical analysis part of my thesis stopped working. Not only that - the main library for portfolio optimization PyPortfolioOpt at the time is not working in Python 3.12 environment. What the hell!?!? Why this cruel & ungodly punishment is being brought upon me? For couple of days I tried to restore everything to the same place (fortunately I have requirements.txt file with versions of libraries used in the project. Good practice, highly recommend generating ones in your programming projects), but it was just too much work and I was too frustrated. 

Fortunately I am very unique, but not as unique as one might think. So soon I found out that probably thousands (if not more) of people over the world have similar version dependency problems and there is a huge software company (or two - if we consider Microsoft's Visual Studio Code as the second one. Microsoft rings a bell, right?) that address this issue. Suspense music. Here comes Docker.

## Docker Desktop and Dev Containers to the rescue (for Windows, I plan to pick up Linux somewhere along the lines)

I could explain what is Docker and what is Visual Studio Code, but it's better if you read it on their website. If you don't like what you find there - that means this post is not for you.

So, let's work on what steps we need to take to make the magic happen.

### I. Install necessary software

Download & install those bad-boys:  
1) [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)  

2) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  

### II. Create a folder for your container

Let's violate all of the terms of Geneva Conventions and for the sake of this post directly create your folder on your C: drive.

```
C:\AwesomeFolder\KickAssContainer
```

### III. Create Dockerfile

Dockerfile is needed (at least to my current knowledge) to create your container. It contains instructions telling Docker Desktop "how" your container should look like.

Warning: filename has to be Dockerfile (no extension; case sensitive; you can create it Via notepad / Visual Studio Code / Notepad ++). Otherwise Docker won't use it.

My example of Dockerfile contents
```
# Base image - for python environments mostly Python
FROM python:3.9-slim

# set the working directory
WORKDIR /code

# install dependencies
COPY ./requirements.txt ./

RUN pip install PyPortfolioOpt  && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# copy the src to the folder
COPY ./src ./src
```
What is happening here? Let's explain step-by-step:
a) FROM python:3.9-slim - install Python Image. List of python images available here: [python images](https://hub.docker.com/_/python)


b) WORKDIR /code - folder name on your container with files that you will want to execute on that container.

c) COPY /.requirements.txt ./ - this command will copy requirements.txt file (containing version of all your Python libraries to install on the container) to your WORKDIR

d) RUN pip install PyPortfolioOpt  && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt

Now this is a tricky one. Using "\" and && allows Docker to execute multiple commands in the environment one after another. For package installation we use pip, which is a Python package installer ([pypi webpage](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)). 

Firstly, PIP will install specific package PyPortfolioOpt (huge shoutout to Robert Martin, who is the main developer of this package. You can check the package documentation here: [PyPortfolioOpt](https://pyportfolioopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UserGuide.html) and Robert's website here: [Reasonable deviations](https://reasonabledeviations.com/). Why do we need to call it like that? Because unlike most other packages that we have in our requirements file this package have different alias (PyPortfolioOpt) in pip and different while calling/installing the package to your Python instance (pypfopt). And if that's the case for some reason we have to do this workaround to install the package properly. If you find this not precise enough and have more knowledge, please drop me a message and I will happily learn more ;).

Secondly, we now install all packages from requirements file, where options no-cache-dir prevents pip from storing additional installation files and source files on your container (you want to keep Docker image as small as possible). The "-r" command points out that next string will be pointing out to a requirements file (requirements.txt in our case).

e)  Copy the "src" folder to our container. Having all your project codes & files in  "src" project is a common practice.
### IV. Create docker-compose.yml

You can read about what is YAML here: [YAML Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).  Basically Docker will use it as set of commands for the container.

Our docker-compose.yml (you can also create this file in VS Code, notepad++ etc.; it's case sensitive and just save the file as .yml extension) file will look as this:

```
services:
    dev_env:
        build: .
        container_name: docker-python
        command: sleep infinity
        volumes:
            - .:/code
```

What are we telling Docker to do here?

a) services - this is a list of services that we want Docker to run on our container. 

b) dev_env - user-defined name of service. I want to have a development environment, that's why I used dev_name. You want to notice that this is part of services, so that's why we keep indentation.

c) build: . - dot signals that we have a DockerFile in the same folder as docker-compose.yml file and this will be used to create our container

d) container_name - user-defined name of container. Should be unique and meaningful.

e) command: sleep infinity - this is a command specifically used for debuginng and dev environment. Good containers are small in size and carry out only a set of specialized instructions. After those instructions are done - container closes with exit code 0 ("container exited normally" - there are no more instructions to execute). Our case is different - we want to have a live Python development environment, where we can play around for unspecified amount of time. To achieve that - we ask container to "sleep" indefinitely. That way it will be in use until we specifically command the container to shut down. 

Warning: While this command is useful in our case it might cause trouble in a lot of different cases. Containers execute commands in order - that means that if you build a multi-service container and you ask it to wait indefinitely before executing some other instructions (like calling a database service) - it might never finish. Be mindful of that.

f) volumes: .:/code - volume is a great Docker concept that allows us to share resources across containers and machine that creates containers. This command basically means that our work directory (as specified in section [[#III. Create Dockerfile]]) will be shared across your personal computer and container. So in practical terms: whatever change you will do to your files and codes in your container -> it gets saved back to original drive location (in our case C:\AwesomeFolder\KickAssContainer)

### V. Requirements file

This is file containg all packages and their versions to be installed on your container environment. This is crucial for dependency management - if you specify wrong versions here, you might have problems with code development.

If you do not know how to create requirement.txt file, you can look it up in those places (I use session-info package):
1) [session info package](https://pypi.org/project/session-info/)
2) [pipreqs package](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/)
3) [pip freeze cmd](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-requirements-txt-file-in-python/)

In my project requirements.txt file looks as below

```
matplotlib==3.6.3
mplfinance==0.12.9b7
numpy==1.24.1
pandas==1.5.3
scipy==1.10.0
session_info==1.0.0
IPython==8.8.0
jupyter_client==7.4.9
jupyter_core==4.11.1
jupyterlab==3.4.4
notebook==6.4.12
```

You might notice that I don't have PyPortfolioOpt specified here. That's because I directly ask pip to install this package in [[#III. Create Dockerfile]] section.

What you can see in the file is that we specify strong equality - which means that pip will install exactly those specified versions of packages. You can specify greater or equal versions using ">=" or compatible versions using "~=" (to be honest, never tried this one).

From matplotlib to session_info those are additional packages. Below that IPython through notebook are versions of Jupyter Notebook packages. You don't have to necessarily specify those, but session-info package has this option and I personally like to be more safe than sorry.

So overall our KickAssContainer folder contents looks like this:

### VI. Start your container

Yet another program to start and adventure to survive! Now that we have our container setup configured in Docker files, we can start our container. In order to do that we will have to open [Windows PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview) (preferably with administrator privileges - so run as Administrator).

Now we will execute couple of commands. 
Warning: In order for that to work you have to have Docker Desktop launched (don't worry if you open your desktop shortcut and it doesn't pop-up on main screen. Docker likes to hide in hidden icons of system tray)

```
cd C:\AwesomeFolder\KickAssContainer
ls
docker-compose up -d
```

Below screen bears fruits of our commands:

![Contents of PowerShell](../../../assets/images/001P_04IMG.png)

What happened?

a) cd C:\AwesomeFolder\KickAssContainer - cd is short for "change directory". Changed directory to our containers directory.

b) ls - short for list. Listed files in the directory to make sure that you are in the right directory. Spoiler alert: you are.

c) docker-compose up -d - creating our container from docker-compose.yml file. This provides a substantial log (at least for the first time) covering all steps necessary to launch specified container. Option -d stands for detached - post executing container composing it will allow you to execute other commands in PowerShell. Without this option Container would block PowerShell and you would not be able to do anything until you specifically shut the container down using ctrl + c shortcut.

We can see from the image that container build lasted 66,2 seconds on my laptop, most of which was packages installation & pip upgrade. This is probably the place, where more advanced Docker users can make the container lighter and faster.

Is there any proof of container up and running? Yes there is, please find this screen from Docker Desktop:
![Docker Desktop docker-python container started](../../../assets/images/001P_05IMG.png)

Now that we have our container we can start learning how to use it.
### V. Develop code in Visual Studio Code

You are getting close to coding in on your development environment now.

First, we need to open Visual Studio Code (my screenshots will be dark, because my soul is dark) and install some extensions.

![Docker Desktop docker-python container started](../../../assets/images/001P_06IMG.jpg)

So:
1) Go to "extensions" panel
2) Type whatever extension you need in search box
3) Install (on my screen button says "uninstall", because I have this extension already installed)

Necessary extensions to be installed that way: Docker & Dev Containers.

List of extensions that I am using currently:

- autopep8 - formatting support for Python
- Dev Containers - support containers on local machine
- Docker - support for Docker
- Github Copilot - paid AI code-along assistant
- Jupyter - for jupyter notebook support (interactive programming)
- Pylance - language support for Python
- Python - my programming language

It time to switch to the virtual machine:

![Docker Desktop docker-python container started](../../../assets/images/001P_07IMG.png)

1) On the bottom left side of your VS Code interface click on "><" icon saying "Open a Remote Window"
2) You will see a list in command panel. Select "Attach to running container"
3) Select "docker-python" container
4) A wild VS Code window should appear (Pokemon GameBoy game reference for older players ;) )

If you did everything correctly you should see something like this on the bottom left side of the interface.
