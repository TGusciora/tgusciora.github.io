Family Guy reference intended. Great series.

Have you ever tried to work on a project for so long, that your open-source libraries stopped cooperating? Do you have an environment that needs to run multiple programs on different versions of software? Visual Studio Code + Docker Desktop might be just the right combination for you.

Because it's rather not a question if that will happen, but when.

## A little bit of history (and a personal touch)

I consider myself a recovering lazy person. Throughout my life I have been living in a spiral of periods of excessive activity (sports, reading or partying) mixed with periods of numbness (playing games whole day, watching series all day, watching that one last video of cat riding through a rainbow at the end of the Internet). That changed when I introduced 2 elements to my daily routine: structure and small successes. But that's a story for another time. 

One of artifacts that I have from such periods of numbness is that I have never finished my master's thesis (thankfully at least I have my bachelor's degree). Actually twice I came close. In 2015 when I was first finishing my master's courses I became eligible to write a masters thesis. But I didn't do anything except thinking of a title. Then I moved overseas and didn't think about it a lot, but unfinished business hanged around my neck like a rock. I came back to my country in 2019 and around 2020 I decided that I will take master's courses again. And so I did - I switched to a slightly different type of degree within Economics department, had to pass around 15 subjects due to differences in programme, and in 2022 ended up in the same scenario that I had in 2015. I had to write my master's thesis. Obviously it would be just too simple if I would write it immediately then. So I started to work on it just in 2023. Small steps - everyday 30 min focused block of working on it (again, story for another time).

Until October everything was going fine - I got 30 pages written in LaTeX (you probably picked up already that I like to make things more difficult than they should be. Or I like ambitious tasks. Or both. It depends.). Then I enrolled to a very labour-intensive AI Development course - which I spent around 5 weeks on without working on anything else. During course to communicate and use Python OpenAI library I did update my Python version from 3.9 to 3.12. When I finished the course and returned in glory - I decided to resume working on my thesis. 

Then it happened. The horror. The code that I was writing for the empirical analysis part of my thesis stopped working. Not only that - the main library for portfolio optimization PyPortfolioOpt at the time is not working in Python 3.12 environment. What the hell!?!? Why this cruel & ungodly punishment is being brought upon me? For couple of days I tried to restore everything to the same place (fortunately I have requirements.txt file with versions of libraries used in the project. Good practice, highly recommend generating ones in your programming projects), but it was just too much work and I was too frustrated. 

Fortunately I am very unique, but not as unique as one might think. So soon I found out that probably thousands (if not more) of people over the world have similar version dependency problems and there is a huge software company (or two - if we consider Microsoft's Visual Studio Code as the second one. Microsoft rings a bell, right?) that address this issue. Suspense music. Here comes Docker.

## Docker Desktop and Dev Containers to the rescue (for Windows, I plan to pick up Linux somewhere along the lines)

I could explain what is Docker and what is Visual Studio Code, but it's better if you read it on their website. If you don't like what you find there - that means this post is not for you.

So, let's work on what steps we need to take to make the magic happen.

### I. Install necessary software

Download & install those bad-boys:
1) Docker: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2) Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

### II. Create a folder for your container

Let's violate all of the terms of Geneva Conventions and for the sake of this post directly create your folder on your C: drive.

```
C:\AwesomeFolder\KickAssContainer
```

### III. Create Dockerfile

Dockerfile is needed (at least to my current knowledge) to create your container. It contains instructions telling Docker Desktop "how" your container should look like.

Warning: filename has to be Dockerfile (no extension; case sensitive; you can create it Via notepad / Visual Studio Code / Notepad ++). Otherwise Docker won't use it.

My example of Dockerfile contents
```
# Base image - for python environments mostly Python
FROM python:3.9-slim

# set the working directory
WORKDIR /code

# install dependencies
COPY ./requirements.txt ./

RUN pip install PyPortfolioOpt  && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# copy the src to the folder
COPY ./src ./src
```
What is happening here? Let's explain step-by-step:
a) FROM python:3.9-slim - install Python Image. List of python images available here: https://hub.docker.com/_/python

b) WORKDIR /code - folder name on your container with files that you will want to execute on that container.

c) COPY /.requirements.txt ./ - this command will copy requirements.txt file (containing version of all your Python libraries to install on the container) to your WORKDIR

d) RUN pip install PyPortfolioOpt  && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt

Now this is a tricky one. Using "\" and && allows Docker to execute multiple commands in the environment one after another. For package installation we use pip, which is a Python package installer ( https://pypi.org/project/pip/ ). 

Firstly, PIP will install specific package PyPortfolioOpt (huge shoutout to Robert Martin, who is the main developer of this package. You can check the package documentation here: https://pyportfolioopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UserGuide.html and Robert's website here: https://reasonabledeviations.com/). Why do we need to call it like that? Because unlike most other packages that we have in our requirements file this package have different alias (PyPortfolioOpt) in pip and different while calling/installing the package to your Python instance (pypfopt). And if that's the case for some reason we have to do this workaround to install the package properly. If you find this not precise enough and have more knowledge, please drop me a message and I will happily learn more ;).

Secondly, we now install all packages from requirements file, where options no-cache-dir prevents pip from storing additional installation files and source files on your container (you want to keep Docker image as small as possible). The "-r" command points out that next string will be pointing out to a requirements file (requirements.txt in our case).

e)  Copy the "src" folder to our container. Having all your project codes & files in  "src" project is a common practice, so overall our KickAssContainer folder contents looks like this:

### IV. Create docker-compose.yml

You can read about what is YAML here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML .  Basically Docker will use it as set of commands for the container.

Our docker-compose.yml (you can also create this file in VS Code, notepad++ etc.; it's case sensitive and just save the file as .yml extension) file will look as this:

```
services:
    dev_env:
        build: .
        container_name: docker-python
        command: sleep infinity
        volumes:
            - .:/code
```

What are we telling Docker to do here?

a) services - this is a list of services that we want Docker to run on our container. 
b) dev_env - user-defined name of service. I want to have a development environment, that's why I used dev_name. You want to notice that this is part of services, so that's why we keep indentation.
