Family Guy reference intended. Great series.

Have you ever tried to work on a project for so long, that your open-source libraries stopped cooperating? Visual Studio Code + Docker Desktop might be just the right combination for you.

# A little bit of history (you can skip this part)

I consider myself a recovering lazy person. Throughout my life I have been living in a spiral of periods of excessive activity (sports, reading or partying) mixed with periods of numbness (playing games whole day, watching series all day, watching that one last video of cat riding through a rainbow at the end of the Internet). That changed when I introduced 2 elements to my daily routine: structure and small successes. But that's a story for another time. 

One of artifacts that I have from such periods of numbness is that I have never finished my master's thesis (thankfully at least I have my bachelor's degree). Actually twice I came close. In 2015 when I was first finishing my master's courses I became eligible to write a masters thesis. But I didn't do anything except thinking of a title. Then I moved overseas and didn't think about it a lot, but unfinished business hanged around my neck like a rock. I came back to my country in 2019 and around 2020 I decided that I will take master's courses again. And so I did - I switched to a slightly different type of degree within Economics department, had to pass around 15 subjects due to differences in programme, and in 2022 ended up in the same scenario that I had in 2015. I had to write my master's thesis. Obviously it would be just too simple if I would write it immediately then. So I started to work on it just in 2023. Small steps - everyday 30 min focused block of working on it (again, story for another time).

Until October everything was going fine - I got 30 pages written in LaTeX (you probably picked up already that I like to make things more difficult than they should be. Or I like ambitious tasks. Or both. It depends.). Then I enrolled to a very labour-intensive AI Development course - which I spent around 5 weeks on without working on anything else. During course to communicate and use Python OpenAI library I did update my Python version from 3.9 to 3.12. When I finished the course and returned in glory - I decided to resume working on my thesis. 

Then it happened. The horror. The code that I was writing for the empirical analysis part of my thesis stopped working. Not only that - the main library for portfolio optimization PyPortfolioOpt at the time is not working in Python 3.12 environment. What the hell!?!? Why this cruel & ungodly punishment is being brought upon me? For couple of days I tried to restore everything to the same place (fortunately I have requirements.txt file with versions of libraries used in the project. Good practice, highly recommend generating ones in your programming projects), but it was just too much work and I was too frustrated. 

Fortunately I am very unique, but not as unique as one might think. So soon I found out that probably thousands (if not more) of people over the world have similar version dependency problems and there is a huge software company (or two - if we consider Microsoft's Visual Studio Code as the second one. Microsoft rings a bell, right?) that address this issue. Suspense music. Here comes Docker.

# Docker Desktop (for Windows, I plan to pick up Linux somewhere along the lines)

Start of the second paragraph. My god I have already 3 500 characters. How did this happen.

```
# Docker commands
# 1) First launch docker desktop or docker to run :)

# command to build image:
docker build -t fastapi-image .
# . means that its in the current directory (so you have to first go to there with .)

# check mounted docker images
docker images 

# running image
docker run --name fastapi-container -p 80:80 fastapi-image
# -p 80:80 - mapping port 80 to 80
# fastapi-container - name of the container
# fastapi-images - name of the image
```
