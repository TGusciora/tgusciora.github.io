Family Guy reference intended. Great series.

Have you ever tried to work on a project for so long, that your open-source libraries stopped cooperating? Do you have an environment that needs to run multiple programs on different versions of software? Visual Studio Code + Docker Desktop might be just the right combination for you.

Because it's rather not a question if that will happen, but when.

# A little bit of history (you can skip this part)

I consider myself a recovering lazy person. Throughout my life I have been living in a spiral of periods of excessive activity (sports, reading or partying) mixed with periods of numbness (playing games whole day, watching series all day, watching that one last video of cat riding through a rainbow at the end of the Internet). That changed when I introduced 2 elements to my daily routine: structure and small successes. But that's a story for another time. 

One of artifacts that I have from such periods of numbness is that I have never finished my master's thesis (thankfully at least I have my bachelor's degree). Actually twice I came close. In 2015 when I was first finishing my master's courses I became eligible to write a masters thesis. But I didn't do anything except thinking of a title. Then I moved overseas and didn't think about it a lot, but unfinished business hanged around my neck like a rock. I came back to my country in 2019 and around 2020 I decided that I will take master's courses again. And so I did - I switched to a slightly different type of degree within Economics department, had to pass around 15 subjects due to differences in programme, and in 2022 ended up in the same scenario that I had in 2015. I had to write my master's thesis. Obviously it would be just too simple if I would write it immediately then. So I started to work on it just in 2023. Small steps - everyday 30 min focused block of working on it (again, story for another time).

Until October everything was going fine - I got 30 pages written in LaTeX (you probably picked up already that I like to make things more difficult than they should be. Or I like ambitious tasks. Or both. It depends.). Then I enrolled to a very labour-intensive AI Development course - which I spent around 5 weeks on without working on anything else. During course to communicate and use Python OpenAI library I did update my Python version from 3.9 to 3.12. When I finished the course and returned in glory - I decided to resume working on my thesis. 

Then it happened. The horror. The code that I was writing for the empirical analysis part of my thesis stopped working. Not only that - the main library for portfolio optimization PyPortfolioOpt at the time is not working in Python 3.12 environment. What the hell!?!? Why this cruel & ungodly punishment is being brought upon me? For couple of days I tried to restore everything to the same place (fortunately I have requirements.txt file with versions of libraries used in the project. Good practice, highly recommend generating ones in your programming projects), but it was just too much work and I was too frustrated. 

Fortunately I am very unique, but not as unique as one might think. So soon I found out that probably thousands (if not more) of people over the world have similar version dependency problems and there is a huge software company (or two - if we consider Microsoft's Visual Studio Code as the second one. Microsoft rings a bell, right?) that address this issue. Suspense music. Here comes Docker.

# Docker Desktop and Dev Containers to the rescue (for Windows, I plan to pick up Linux somewhere along the lines)

I could explain what is Docker and what is Visual Studio Code, but it's better if you read it on their website. If you don't like what you find there - that means this post is not for you.

So, let's work on what steps we need to take to make the magic happen.

## I. Install necessary software

Download & install those bad-boys:
1) Docker: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2) Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

## II. Create a folder for your container

Let's violate all of the terms of Geneva Conventions and for the sake of this post directly create your folder on your C: drive.

```
C:\AwesomeFolder\KickAssContainer
```

## III. Create Dockerfile

Dockerfile (no extesion) is needed (at least to my current knowledge) to create your container. It contains instructions telling Docker Desktop "how" your container should look like.

Warning: filename has to be Dockerfile (no extension; case sensitive; you can create it Via notepad / Visual Studio Code / Notepad ++). Otherwise Docker won't pick it up.

My example of Dockerfile contents
```
# Base image - for python environments mostly Python
FROM python:3.9-slim

# set the working directory
WORKDIR /code

# install dependencies
COPY ./requirements.txt ./

RUN pip install --upgrade pip \
    pip install yfinance && \
    pip install PyPortfolioOpt  && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt
# --no-cache-dir - because docker has its own cache

# Docker can cache each step, so it's a good practice to have requirements separately (because they don't change so often)

# copy the src to the folder
COPY ./src ./src
```
